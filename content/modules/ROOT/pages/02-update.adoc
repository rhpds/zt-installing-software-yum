The `+list+` subcommand is useful for finding out which packages have
available updates on the system.

[source,bash]
----
dnf list updates
----

Many packages on this system have updates available. Specifying a
package name with `+dnf update+` will constrain this operation to only
look for that package.

____
_NOTE:_ If you instead want to make sure your entire system is up to
date, running `+dnf update+` without any other arguments apply updates
for all packages on your system (including YUM itself).
____

At the time of writing this lab, the *bash* package required an update.
Letâ€™s update *bash*. Use the `+-y+` option to automatically say yes to
any prompts for the purposes of this lab.

Feel free to update any package listed.

[source,bash]
----
dnf -y update bash
----

____
_NOTE:_ You sometimes see the subcommand `+upgrade+` being used somewhat
interchangeably with `+update+`. The difference between these two
subcommands is that `+upgrade+` will remove any obsolete packages from
the system. Often the configuration for DNF is such that these
subcommands will both carry out the `+upgrade+` operation.

== Removing a package

Removing a package follows the same theme of simplicity.

[source,bash]
----
dnf -y remove httpd
----

The extensive output shows you information about which dependent RPMs
were removed as part of this transaction.

Use the `+list+` subcommand to confirm that the package has been
uninstalled:

[source,bash]
----
dnf list httpd
----

The package is now listed as _Available_ rather than _Installed_. The
next step will walk you through `+dnf history+` which provides some more
powerful tools for rolling back package transactions.
